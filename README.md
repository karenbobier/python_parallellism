# python_parallellism
testing different options to run python code with parallelism

Scripts used to run the speed test are in [examples](https://github.com/karenbobier/python_parallellism/tree/main/examples).

An example fasta file is [here](https://github.com/karenbobier/python_parallellism/blob/main/fastas/sequences.fasta) though I used a much larger fasta file for the actual test.

These scripts could be adapted to run a variety of python functions using parallelism or multiprocessing.
